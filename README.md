### About Ada Lovelace Website
This was one of my first projects. A very very very simple site using only html/css/javascript and that tells the story of women who made history in technology.

This website was developed during the Programaria (https://www.programaria.org/) course to explore the universe of codes with this introductory course to programming with a focus on web development. Ideal to take the first step of your journey as a web developer and make your first website.
