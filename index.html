        <h2>Ada Lovelace</h2>

        <p class="indent"> Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace, was born in London in 1815, better known as Ada Lovelace, was the
            first person to write an algorithm to be processed by a machine in the history of computing.</p>

            <h3 class="green-title">Childhood</h3>
            <p class="indent"> His father was the romantic poet Lord Byron, known for his exaggerations, like having a tamed bear in his
                bedroom and by acts unusual for the time.Your mother was the rich
                and the cultured Annabella Milbanke, passionate about mathematics and not very patient with her
                husband's crazy things.<br>
                Lord Byron drank too much which resulted in the divorce when Ada was only 5 weeks old. Annabella went
                single mother concerned to ensure that Ada did not look like her father. Invested in rigorous education
                of the
                girl hiring the best teachers. He believed that if his daughter was interested in math and
                sciences, he would distance himself from poetry and the eccentric tendencies inherited from his father.<br>
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                Ada was fascinated by math and poetry. At the age of twelve, he was enchanted by the
                mechanical engineering and wrote a book called Flyology (or Voology) with drawings of a plan for the
                building a flying machine. When she told her mother about the machine, Annabelle thought that Ada
                he was deviating from his studies and repressed it. So he asked Ada to focus on becoming a lady.<br>

            <h3 class="red-title">Youth</h3>

            <p class="indent"> At the age of 17, Ada was introduced to the court and was invited to parties in the city. Your way
                smart and quick attracted many singles, but she became interested in an old mathematician named
                Charles Babage, who told him about the invention he had been working on for years, the "differential
                machine", which did great calculations.<br>

                Charles liked the young woman, she was one of the few people who was interested and understood his
                inventions.
                When Ada got to know the differential machine, she saw in it many possibilities that not even Charles had thought. The enthusiasm of the young mathematician impressed him.</p>

        <section id="adulthood">
            <h3 class="yellow-title">Adulthood</h3>

            <p class="indent">
                Charles was a widower and was fighting for investments for his projects. Ada got married and had 3
                children. In
                1830, this meant that she had to give up her studies and devote herself to her children. Exchanged
                letters with
                Charles, followed his work from afar. He had little time for his own studies. passed to
                solve math problems at night after the children sleep. She wanted to work with Charles
                on your amazing machines.

                Later, Charles created the Analytical Engine, better than the differential machine, as it would be able
                to
                to analyze data and store information in memory. Something so revolutionary that few people
                understood. To publicize his new machine, he would need to publish articles in French, a language he
                doesn't
                knew, but Ada was fluent. As she understood Charles's creations, she was the perfect person to
                translate these articles.
            <p class="indent">
                While Ada translated the content, took notes on her own, imagined countless possibilities
                that the machine would have. It didn't take long for his annotations to grow larger than the article
                itself.
                Charles wanted the machine to solve mathematical problems. Ada was thinking about something much bigger:
                the
                numbers could represent totally different things like letters and musical notes. He wrote
                detailed instructions with diagrams and tables explaining how the analytical engine should process a
                complicated math equation. Thus, the machine would solve in seconds what a human would take hours
                to solve. Computers didn't exist yet, but Ada had just created the first program
                of computer. Ada didn't live to see that her ideas would become the modern computers that
                we use it today.
